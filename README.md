## Reanimated V2
> Due to performance issues, this example has been rewritten using [React Native Reanimated V2](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated) You can check this branch for [Animated API](https://github.com/m-inan/react-native-music-app/tree/animated_api).

## Track Player
> [React Native Track Player](https://github.com/react-native-kit/react-native-track-player) package is used for this example. However, since the release version does not have "Shuffle" and "Repeat" features, [this](https://github.com/m-inan/react-native-track-player) repository is used.

## Features

- Offline Playing
- Remote Control
- Customizable playlists
- Static sounds and artwork files
- Next, previous, shuffle, and replay
